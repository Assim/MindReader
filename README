The Mind Reader is an application capable of knowing the number on your mind based on how you answer the questions provided by it.

The directory structure is created using Eclipse IDE, you can simply import this project. I created a "jar" folder containing the application as a runnable jar file, make sure to update the jar if you change the source code so that it will reflect the changes.
